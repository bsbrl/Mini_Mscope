Whole-cortex imaging in freely behaving mice using a head-mounted miniaturized microscope (mini-mScope). CMOS sensor sourced from the [Miniscope](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki).

The current version of the mini-mScope meets several experimental conditions highlighted below.

* Access to ~8x10 mm field of view of the mouse dorsal cortex
* Resolution ranges from ~39-56 micrometers across the field of view
* Weighs less than 15% of the mouse body weight (3.8 grams)
* Uniformly illuminates ~75% of the dorsal cortex with blue excitation light
* Green reflectance channel allows for hemodynamic correction ~65% of the field of view
* Does not impede mouse natural behavior (>1 hour mounting time with minimal effects on mouse traversed distance or speed)
* Posterior tail screw minimizes motion artifacts during vigorous, natural mouse behavior and during complex tasks, such as social interaction
